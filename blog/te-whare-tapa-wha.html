        <h2>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>
          For Taha Tinana I will continue on with eating well, and going for a
          long walk every day. ALso I'm considering joining the nearby gym once
          bootcamp gets started, as a way to counteract what will be (I assume)
          a mammoth amount of sitting and looking at a screen!

        <h2>Taha Wh훮nau (Family Wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>
          Taha Wh훮nau, for me, is about being in touch with all three of my kids
          regularly. The two older ones have left home but flat in wellington,
          so it's easy for me to catch up with them regularly. Also, staying in
          touch with my parents and sisters via Facebook messenger (a few times
          a week) and vising my parents and one sister in Palmerston North every
          couple of months, helps keep that connection strong.

        <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>
          My focus for Taha Hinengaro will be looking after my emotional and
          mental wellbeing by using my morning walk as a time for both
          mindfulness and letting my thoughts wander. So I don't listen to
          podcasts or music but just be. I find this is one of the most
          effective ways I can unwind and de-stress. Also, I will meditate for
          at least 10 minutes a day, and keep a daily journal. But probably most
          important, my communication and relationship with my wife helps to
          keep me emotionally and mentally balanced and healthy, and doing fun
          things together (usually involving eating food and visiting op-shops)
          is restorative!

        <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>
          For me, my spiritual wellbeing - Taha Wairua - is most deeply
          maintained by making art of various forms. This has been less to the
          fore lately, so I will aim to start a regular routine of spending time
          painting, collaging or drawing. Probably a weekend day regularly, once
          I've settled into the bootcamp routine.

        <h2>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h2>
        <p>
          My connection to the Whenua is though my daily walking along the
          waterfront, and we plan to start doing long walks (eg the southern
          walkway) in the weekends, which used to be regular but has dropped off
          a bit over the last months. Also I like to look at the clouds out the
          living room windows, the best view from the apartment!
