    <h3>Sprint 2 explainer page</h3>

    <p>
      You should use class if you want to apply the style to multiple elements
      on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should use id for just one element on a page - at max - or you might
      end up with nasty bugs!
    </p>
    <p>
      So although they seem to be doing similar stuff, keep this distinction in
      mind.
