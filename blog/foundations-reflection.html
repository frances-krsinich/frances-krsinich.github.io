      <h2>Three new things</h2>
      <p>
      Three new things I've learnt about myself and my ego via the core learnings in foundations: </p>
   <p>1. I tend to jump ahead and dive into things rather than taking the time to read all instructions carefully
  and the return to reading them - this is likely due to a form of arrogance about thinking I already
      
know what to do, so more humility is in order! </p> 
<p>2. I need to realise that my brain can still rewire and learn new things. That the difficulty
and frustration that I experience when learning new things is a sign that the 
brain-muscles are building and it is something to be embraced rather than avoided.</p>
<p>3. I can be a better listener to others by sitting back and just... listening. Rather than
focussing on what and how I can contribute to what they're saying. This is a much better,
more compassionate and ultimately more useful way of listening.</p>

      <h2>The role of values, empathy and self-awareness</h2>
      <p>
        Self awareness means that I can be more conscious of what's going on in my mind
        and body when I'm learning, and more consciously notice when I might be avoiding certain
        topics due to difficulty or frustration. Then I can be more deliberate about choosing to
        stay with the task, while taking regular breaks, to learn better.
      </p>
      <p>Empathy is important for understanding that we're all at different points
        on our learning journey, and with different backgrounds and experiences that we're
        bringing to the table. Everyone has their own set of challenges and skills and being 
        aware of this helps us to be more responsive and sensitive when communicating 
        and being with each other.
      </p>
      <p>Values are what motivate me to put the time and effort into learning and developing
        during this course. I strongly value my ability to create new and useful things, and 
        keeping that front of mind helps to provide the context for why I'm here and why 
        I want to be giving it full attention.

      <h2>What's surprised me?</h2>
      <p>The importance of these core skills to being a good programmer has surprised me 
        but it makes a lot of sense. In my current job at Stats NZ (and previously 
        at other organisations) it's really clear that the people with good communication skills, 
        self awareness and a clear set of values underpinning why they're in the job, is much 
        more important than what technical skills they happen to possess.

      <h2>The most challenging aspects of core so far</h2>
      <p>The most challenging aspects of core have been prioritising it alongside 
        the tech material. While I know it's important, it tends to get shuffled down 
        the list of what I need to do, in comparison with the more tangible material 
        of the tech part of the course.
      </p>
      <p>It's also been challenging to realise that I may not be as good a 
        communicator as I had assumed, and also that I have a lot to learn and 
        need to deal usefully with the frustrations of not 'getting' things straight away. Being 
        patient with myself is not something that comes naturally to me!

      <h2>Why so much focus on core skills?</h2>
      <p>It makes complete sense to me that Dev Academy focusses on core skills so much. This is 
        probably the point of difference between the course and other web development bootcamps. I can 
        see that it is a very useful skill to be nurturing in students in response 
        to what industry wants to see in the new recruits they're looking for. <p>

      <h2>Was it a waste of time?</h2>
      <p>
        Not at all! I think the core material has been a really crucial part of the course so 
        far and I look forward to learning more during the bootcamp in this area. In particular 
        I appreciate the extra resources that we've been pointed to along the way 
        in the core curriculum.
