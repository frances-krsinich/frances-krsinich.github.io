    <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
    <p>
      The ability to perceive, understand, use and manage emotions in oneself
      and others. Being self-aware, having empathy for others and an ability to
      think before reacting to emotions.
    </p>

    <p>Aristotle said</p>
    <p>
      "Anyone can become angry—that is easy. But to be angry with the right
      person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and
      in the right way—that is not easy."

    <h1>How is EQ different to IQ?</h1>

    <p>
      EQ is the ability to perceive your own or others’ emotions, while IQ is a
      measure of reason and academic ability. Unlike IQ, EQ can be learned, both
      by children and adults.
    </p>
    <h1>Why is EQ important?</h1>
    Because the real world is complex, ambiguous, changeable and uncertain.
    Emotional intelligence is a powerful tool to help us navigate this world and
    the other humans in it.
