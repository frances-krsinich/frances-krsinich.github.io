        <h2>The relationship between Javascript, HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          HTML, CSS and Javascript all work together to make an interactive
          web-page. HTML provides the structure and contents, CSS provides the
          style, and Javascript provides the functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          One way to understand the relationship between the three is with the
          analogy of a piece of clothing, let's say a tramping jacket. The HTML
          is the structure and content of the jacket - it has two arms, a zip
          down the front, and a hood.
        </p>

        <!-- <img
          class="bounding-box"
          src="../images/Rain-Jacket.web_.jpg"
          alt="trampingJacket"
        /> -->

        <p>
          The CSS is the style of the jacket - perhaps it's green, with a logo
          on the front, and stripey cuffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Javascript is the functionality of the jacket - how strong the
          stitching is, whether it's waterproof, breathable, and the
          stretchability of the fabric. Also, if it's recyclable, this is
          another aspect of its functionality (the JavaScript), rather than its
          structure and content (the HTML) or its style, the way it looks (the
          CSS).

        <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
        <p>
          Control flow is the order in which code is executed, and this will be
          from top to bottom unless and until loops, conditionals or functions
          are encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a bit like how we might read a book. We start reading at the
          begining, and potentially could keep reading right to the end, unless
          something is encountered along the way. For example, we might come
          across a word that we don't understand, so we stop reading and look it
          up on google. Or perhaps we get bored of the book and decide to
          abandon it half-read. Or we put the book down because we get tired,
          and then the dog comes and eats it in the night. All of these events
          (needing to look up a word, becoming bored, our dog eating the book)
          are things that alter the control flow of the book-reading, in the
          same way that loops, conditionals and functions might divert the
          top-to-bottom control flow of running code.

        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the interface which
          JavaScript controls to play with the HTML elements in order to
          introduce functionality and interactivity to the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, JavaScript uses the DOM to identify elements on the
          webpage that it wants to do something with. In the JavaScript cafe
          challenge, we used
          <em
            >document.getElementById('customerButton').onclick =
            generateCustomerOrder</em
          >
          to find the customer button (identified by its id) and then, when it
          was clicked, this would run the
          <em>generateCustomerOrder</em> function.

        <h2>Accessing from array versus objects</h2>
        <p>
          An object is any "thing" in javascript, and it stores data in
          key-value pairs. An array is a <em>type</em>
          of object, one in which the data is stored in an ordered way, and for
          which data can be retrieved using an index.

        <h2>Functions - what they are and why they're helpful</h2>
        <p>
          In coding, often we need to be able to repeat a procedure. Functions
          are useful here because, rather than writing the code over and over,
          perhaps with a few changes, we can use a function for all the
          repeatable bits, and parameters to pass into the function the bits
          that need to change.
