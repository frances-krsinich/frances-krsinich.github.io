        <h2>That time I ... was blocked on a simple problem</h2>

        <p>
          Towards the end of sprint 2 I was struggling... really struggling...
          to complete the 9-dot game which was part of the DOM-interactions
          challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up till that point I had been keeping on top of everything, but this
          one really had me stumped. I was googling all over the place,
          searching the Discord, but I really couldn't crack it.
        </p>
        <p>
          While waiting for one of the live workshops to start I thought I might
          as well keep working on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Randomly, I went back to the instructions, and there was a whole
          section at the end which basically told me what to do! No idea whether
          I'd initially read this and then forgotten about it, or never read it
          in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, the big takeaway from this is that I really should read
          instructions. And then reread them. And keep referring back to them,
          particularly if I'm stuck. I guess its possible that I may have read
          it initially but because there was nothing to 'hook it to' it just
          passed through my brain and out the other side.
        </p>

        <h2>That time I ... elegantly solved a problem</h2>

        <p>
          I can't remember exactly which of the katas it was, but for one of
          them I use pseudocode right at the start to map out what I thought the
          process should look like.
        </p>

        <p>
          This seemed to work really well for making it all go smoothly, and
          because I'd chunked it down into managable steps, my approach seemed
          much more elegant than the katas where I just plunged into things
          without the same level of pre-thinking.
        </p>

        <h2>Many many problem solving techniques</h2>

        <p>
          We've been told about lots of different ways to approach problem
          solving, which is awesome. Some of them I've used more than others:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pseudocode:</strong>
          This was really successful which I did use it (see above), and I think
          I need to do more of it. I think it works well because it divides the
          problem up into more managable pieces, and also because it makes me
          feel like I'm making progress before I even start tacking the code
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Trying something:</strong>
          I do a lot of this. Just plunging on in and seeing if things will
          work. Sometimes it's successful but sometimes it leads me down a
          rabbit hole and makes me lose focus. I think it's an approach to be
          used sparingly or in combination with others (including the rereading
          of instructions - again, see above).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong>
          Unfortunately I lack a rubber duck. But I do have pet rock who I think
          could fulfill the same function. However, I haven't yet tried this
          technique, and I think I will aim to in the next sprint. It will be
          interesting to see whether verbalising my coding problems will unlock
          things in a different way than my current go-to problem solving
          approaches. Luckily I'm mainly alone during the day so I don't need to
          feel self-conscious about seeming mad if I use this technique. Note to
          self to try it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading error messages:</strong>
          This really wasn't something I felt comfortable with initially when I
          encountered it during the katas. I'm used to errors feeling like a
          problem to avoid, rather than a useful resource in themselves! But
          once I got the hang of it, it was really useful. Though often I didn't
          identify quite what the solution was, from the error messages, there
          were enough times that they led me in a useful direction that I warmed
          to the idea that errors can be my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Googling:</strong>
          Googling is definitely my go to problem solving approach. By far. As
          well as helping with whatever problem I'm trying to solve, it often
          throws up useful resources that I want to follow up on. This might
          also be its downfall, now that I think about it, because it can be a
          bit of a time sink. However. I think I've become pretty good at
          rapidly skimming results to get what I need when doing the google.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asking my peers for help:</strong>
          This is something I don't do enough. Partly because, if I'm feeling
          behind where most of the cohort are (which I have been) then I worry
          I'll be annoying in a 'been there, done that, moved on' kind of way.
          But I guess I'm doing it in an asynchronous way by making a lot of use
          of searching on the Discord to see if my question (or a close
          relative) has already been asked. This presents some moral quandries,
          as sometimes I have fairly much used someone's answer to solve my
          problem, which feels suspiciously like... cheating? I'm not sure
          whether or how this is different to finding things on Google but I try
          to make sure that I really understand what the code I'm using is doing
          and why. I do like how some people are 'spoilering' their code to help
          guard against this temptation and if I ever on-track enough to be in
          the same position I'll have to look up how to do that myself!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I've found it useful to be
          able to ask questions in the live sessions, and the coaches have been
          very responsive to that. In fact, sometimes I ask questions because
          no-one else is saying anything and it's starting to feel awkward... so
          win-win! I probably need to be doing a bit more of asking coaches if
          I'm stuck, and will try to do so and on Discord so it's searchable by
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Improving my process with reflection:</strong> Hmmm... was
          going to say I haven't really done this but that's not true now I
          think about it. I'm often thinking about something I'm stuck on when
          I'm taking a break or doing something else, which must qualify as
          'reflection'. But it would be useful for me to be doing this more
          deliberately too, rather than just these almost-accidental
          reflections. Another note to self.
        </p>

        <h2>That time I ... was reluctant to ask for help</h2>
        <p>
          In general, I've been a bit reluctant to ask for help when I've been
          behind schedule, partly because I'm feeling a bit bad about being
          behind (and not wanting to draw attention to it) and partly because I
          feel like everyone's moved on to other stuff and will find it a bit
          tiresome to be treading old ground. I hope this will become less of an
          issue due to me having caught up this week and feeling determined not
          to fall behind again.
