        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <p>
          Understanding neuropasticity benefits people by enabling them to
          reinterpret effort and hard work. Rather than seeing these as an
          indication that 'they're not intelligent enough' to understand or
          achieve, they can reframe things to see effort and hard work as an
          indication that their brains are undergoing change into being more
          capable of doing the task or understanding the information.

          This is analogous to building muscle at the gym. The strain and work
          required to lift weights leads to the building of muscle.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

        <p>
          A growth mindset, as opposed to a fixed mindset, is one which
          recognises that the brain is malleable, and can change and develop in
          response to mental effort. That is, it understandss neuropasticity,
          and utilises this understanding by seeing difficulty as a way to
          develop new skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is highly relevant to us at Dev Academy because most of us are
          engaged in learning totally new concepts, and this learning is
          difficult, challenging and at times frustrating. By understanding that
          this difficulty is leading to the development of new pathways in our
          brains, which will make those skills easier over time, we are
          motivated to persevere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was surprised that physical activities like playing piano or even
          building muscle could be enhanced by mental practice. This opens up
          the possibility for me that I might not bother joining the gym after
          all, but instead lie on the couch and imagine lifting weights.
          Win-win!

          I checked this out further, and found this good

          </a>
          which refers to an impressive study (I saw the same study referred to
          in quite a few different articles) that tested a control group against
          a group to visualise flexing their muscles - the test group increased
          their strength by 35% and also strengthened the corresponding neural
          pathways in their brains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relevance for me of all this is that I will view the difficulties
          and occasional frustrations of the course as growth opportunities,
          rather than as indications that I'm not up to the job!

        <h2>Impact on my learning plan and strategies</h2>
        <p>
          The takeaway from all this, for me, is that I will consciously try to
          challenge myself more. Research and read material that is at the edge
          of (or even beyond) what I feel capable of understanding. And attempt
          the stretch excercises as a matter of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I wasn't joking, I really am going to try and build muscle by
          doing the imagining thing - this really appeals!
