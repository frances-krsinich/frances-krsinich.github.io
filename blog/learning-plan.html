        <h2>My long term plan</h2>
        <p>
          I've been wanting to be able to develop my own products that will find
          enough of a market that I could live off them, and hopefully spend
          little enough time maintaining and marketing them that I can have more
          time for other, non-money-making pursuits - like making art, reading
          books, going on long walks and learning new things.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could find some happy intersection of economic measurement (i.e.
          related to my current job in inflation measurement) and art (i.e.
          related to what I like to do in my spare time) then that would be the
          dream! Perhaps an art-investment tool that applies price index methods
          to resale of investment art. Perhaps a social networking tool that
          enables emerging artists to buy each other’s work. Perhaps a tool that
          applies AI to macro-economic data to produce artworks tracking the
          economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failing that, I have some ideas that sit firmly on one side or the
          other like: a data privacy tool that produces synthetic data on the
          fly for analysts who want to access confidential data, or a remote
          art-making site where users can provide specs to artists who make work
          in response to those.
        </p>

        <h2>My learning strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>
          One strength I have is that I’m good at seeing connections across
          different subjects, which means I can often apply simple ideas in new
          ways. On the flipside, I’m limited by being interested in lots of
          things at once, which can make it hard to devote enough time to any
          one of them! It can be hard to focus for long enough and hard enough
          to make as much progress as I’d like.
        </p>
        <h2>Developing core skills</h2>

        <p>
          Getting better at managing my time. Learning how to balance work and
          play so that I don’t burn myself out. Communicating well –
          supportively and constructively – with my fellow students. Keeping on
          track with following the curriculum while still allowing time and
          space for following up things I’m interested in (allowing myself to
          fall down a few interesting rabbit holes, but ... not too far or for
          too long)
        </p>

        <h2>Managing my workload</h2>
        <p>
          I commit to spending regular blocks of time on the work in the
          programme, planning at the start of the week how much of the content I
          need to have covered by the end of each day. I aim to come onsite to
          Dev Academy at least twice a week to work undistracted by home-stuff
          and to meet some of the other students. When and if things start
          building up and getting to me I’ll take a break for a few hours and go
          for a long walk, and if I’m still struggling I’ll get in touch with a
          facilitator to talk it through.
        </p>
        <h2>Seeking help</h2>
        <p>
          I will let others know if I need help, after first searching Discord
          to see if similar issues have already been discussed.
        </p>

        <h2>The facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
          I'd like the facilitators to be supportive, available (within reason)
          and enthusiastic.
        </p>

        <h2>Other commitments</h2>
        <p>
          During foundations I will generally busy in the morning (working
          reduced hours to wrap up loose ends at my job, as enrolling at Dev
          Academy was a spur-of-the-moment decision) so afternoons, evenings and
          weekends will be the times I devote to the course. I’ll be checking
          Discord regularly during the morning in case anything urgent pops up.
          My hours focusing on foundations, then, will be 1pm – 6pm consistently
          through the week, and then more flexibly during the evenings (1-2
          hours) and weekends (3-4 hours on each of Saturday and Sunday).
