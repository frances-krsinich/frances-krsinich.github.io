        <h1>Learning plan - preparing for bootcamp</h1>
        <h2>My long term goal</h2>
        <p>
          This remains the same as at sprint 2's learning plan - I want to
          develop the ability to be able to design and produce my own products,
          so that I have the option to support myself financially without
          working and office job, and to add new and interesting things to the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another aspect to this is that I want to be able to be an example of
          how it's possible to be creative and financially rewarded in a way
          that is self-directed and independent of large organisations. To be
          fully independent is an important value for me.
        </p>
        <h2>Bootcamp: strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>
          My strengths and limitations remain similar to what I identified
          earlier - they are the two flipsides of being interested in lots of
          things. This enables me to see connections across subjects and tools
          (a positive) but also mean that I can find it hard to focus for long
          enough to learn well (a negative). To deal with this, it will be
          important for me to manage my time well, setting goals and using
          techniques like the pomodor timer.
        </p>
        <h2>The biggest non-technical challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Staying on top of the material, and focussing for 9 weeks will both be
          my biggest non-technical challenges on the bootcamp! Also, it will
          probably be quite challenging focussing fully on the course when I'm
          largely working remotely. However, this is a skill that I want to
          develop because it's what I'll need to be doing in my future goal of
          running my own company / developing my own product, because that's
          very likely to be something I do independently - at least in the first
          stages of development.
        </p>
        <h2>The human skills I'd like to develop at Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          Definitely working in teams is something I'd like to get better at in
          Bootcamp. I've tended to work quite independently, which is great in
          lots of ways, but can only get me so far. It's often surprising just
          how much better a solution is when there is a team involved. Often it
          can take longer (which can be a bit frustrating) but the ultimate
          result will be better and more robust.
        </p>
        <h2>Expectations of the bootcamp team</h2>
        <p>
          My expectations of the bootcamp team are enthusiasm, helpfulness and
          compassion. I would like them to be able to point me in new directions
          when I have questions, to be patient when I'm not 'getting' something,
          and respectful of the different perspectives we're all coming from.
        </p>
        <h2>Expectations of myself</h2>
        <p>
          My expectations for myself are that I take the course really
          seriously, putting the bulk of my energy and time into it for the
          duration of bootcamp. I've invested a lot of time and money into doing
          this course so I want to get the maximum amount out of it. For me,
          it's the first time in over 20 years that I have been able to fully
          focus on learning new things, without the need to be working alongside
          that, so I want to get as much as possible out of that.

        <h2>My long term plan</h2>
        <p>
          I've been wanting to be able to develop my own products that will find
          enough of a market that I could live off them, and hopefully spend
          little enough time maintaining and marketing them that I can have more
          time for other, non-money-making pursuits - like making art, reading
          books, going on long walks and learning new things.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could find some happy intersection of economic measurement (i.e.
          related to my current job in inflation measurement) and art (i.e.
          related to what I like to do in my spare time) then that would be the
          dream! Perhaps an art-investment tool that applies price index methods
          to resale of investment art. Perhaps a social networking tool that
          enables emerging artists to buy each other’s work. Perhaps a tool that
          applies AI to macro-economic data to produce artworks tracking the
          economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failing that, I have some ideas that sit firmly on one side or the
          other like: a data privacy tool that produces synthetic data on the
          fly for analysts who want to access confidential data, or a remote
          art-making site where users can provide specs to artists who make work
          in response to those.
        </p>

        <h2>My learning strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>
          One strength I have is that I’m good at seeing connections across
          different subjects, which means I can often apply simple ideas in new
          ways. On the flipside, I’m limited by being interested in lots of
          things at once, which can make it hard to devote enough time to any
          one of them! It can be hard to focus for long enough and hard enough
          to make as much progress as I’d like.
        </p>
        <h2>Developing core skills</h2>

        <p>
          Getting better at managing my time. Learning how to balance work and
          play so that I don’t burn myself out. Communicating well –
          supportively and constructively – with my fellow students. Keeping on
          track with following the curriculum while still allowing time and
          space for following up things I’m interested in (allowing myself to
          fall down a few interesting rabbit holes, but ... not too far or for
          too long)
        </p>

        <h2>Managing my workload</h2>
        <p>
          I commit to spending regular blocks of time on the work in the
          programme, planning at the start of the week how much of the content I
          need to have covered by the end of each day. I aim to come onsite to
          Dev Academy at least twice a week to work undistracted by home-stuff
          and to meet some of the other students. When and if things start
          building up and getting to me I’ll take a break for a few hours and go
          for a long walk, and if I’m still struggling I’ll get in touch with a
          facilitator to talk it through.
        </p>
        <h2>Seeking help</h2>
        <p>
          I will let others know if I need help, after first searching Discord
          to see if similar issues have already been discussed.
        </p>

        <h2>The facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
          I'd like the facilitators to be supportive, available (within reason)
          and enthusiastic.
        </p>

        <h2>Other commitments</h2>
        <p>
          During foundations I will generally busy in the morning (working
          reduced hours to wrap up loose ends at my job, as enrolling at Dev
          Academy was a spur-of-the-moment decision) so afternoons, evenings and
          weekends will be the times I devote to the course. I’ll be checking
          Discord regularly during the morning in case anything urgent pops up.
          My hours focusing on foundations, then, will be 1pm – 6pm consistently
          through the week, and then more flexibly during the evenings (1-2
          hours) and weekends (3-4 hours on each of Saturday and Sunday).
