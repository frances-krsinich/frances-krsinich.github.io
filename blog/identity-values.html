        <h2>A past ethical decision</h2>
        <p>
          I left a higher-paying job at a policy agency a few years ago to
          return to Stats NZ, because I realised that I wanted to be working on
          things with wider application and greater positive impact for society.
        </p>

        <h2>The influence of my culture and the people around me</h2>
        <p>
          I left school after sixth form in the 80's with the explicit goal of
          going on the dole and being an artist and musician like my (older)
          friends. After a few years of playing music and having no money in
          Christchurch I found myself slowly spiralling into a poverty trap,
          which motivated me to study. After a year of mechanical engineering at
          Polytech I returned to my roots (my grandfather and favorite, most
          influential, relative was a statistician) and switched to a maths
          degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming out as queer in the 80's meant being part of a small, largely
          invisible, subculture which was both exciting, strange and ultimately
          freeing. My children now live in a totally different world which is
          awesome to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big influence over the last few years has been a computer scientist
          called Cal Newport, who has written great books on topics like
          'Digital Minimalism' (basically, get off social media) and 'Deep Work'
          (essentially, how to focus on things and do stuff like timeboxing)
        </p>

        <h2>My strengths</h2>
        <p>
          My strengths are enthusiasm, communication and making connections
          across different subjects and methods. I'm good at identifying and
          drawing out other people's interests and skills, and being
          encouraging.
        </p>

        <h2>My limitations</h2>
        <p>
          My limitations are occasional impatience, being interested in too many
          things at once, and having to earn enough money to live on (which
          means I have less time for stuff other than paid-working)
        </p>

        <h2>A past experience of resistance or tension</h2>
        <p>
          Over the last year or so there has been tension at work between
          another team and ours, on a project to replace some old (very old! 25
          years) technology. I ended up holding the short straw as the
          middle-man between the teams (aka the acting product owner) and so
          this has required lots of diplomacy, communication and humour. I spend
          quite a bit of time and effort translating each side to the other and
          providing reassurance to those in my team that are worried they'll
          loose the functionality they need. It's important to keep everyone as
          engaged as possible as it will be a multi-year project that requires
          ongoing effort from us to make sure the redevelopment team understands
          what we need.
